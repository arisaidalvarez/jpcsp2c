Converting jpcsp to c language


A project that i was working ago a few time back but don't have much time to work on it so i decided to open source 
it in case someone want to check (or help)

It is based on an old jpcsp source (something around revision 950 ) . It can run a few framebuffer demos (hellopsp and minifire are the first that comes to my mind).

It has a working threadman , loader , interpreter and a few modules support
